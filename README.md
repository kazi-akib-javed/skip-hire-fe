# Skip Hire Application

A modern, responsive web application for skip hire services built with React and TypeScript.

## Project Goals

This project demonstrates best practices in React development, focusing on:

1. **Clean Code & Maintainability**
   - Component-based architecture
   - Separation of concerns
   - Type safety with TypeScript
   - Custom hooks for reusable logic
   - Proper state management

2. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-first approach
   - Fluid layouts
   - Adaptive components
   - Touch-friendly interfaces

3. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Intuitive navigation
   - Clear visual hierarchy
   - Smooth transitions
   - Accessible design
   - Consistent styling

## Project Approach & Decision Making

### Initial Analysis & Planning

1. **Requirements Breakdown**
   - Identified core features: skip selection, filtering, progress tracking
   - Analyzed user flow and interaction patterns
   - Determined data requirements and state management needs
   - Evaluated performance considerations

2. **Architecture Decisions**
   - Chose React with TypeScript for type safety and maintainability
   - Selected Redux for global state management
   - Implemented custom hooks for reusable logic
   - Adopted a feature-based folder structure

### Design Principles Implementation

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - Separated business logic from UI components
   - Created dedicated components for specific features
   - Isolated data fetching logic in custom hooks
   - Maintained clear boundaries between features

2. **Dependency Inversion**
   - Implemented generic `useFetch` hook for data fetching
   - Created abstract interfaces for data structures
   - Decoupled UI components from data sources
   - Used dependency injection for better testability

3. **Interface Segregation**
   - Defined specific interfaces for each component
   - Created focused props interfaces
   - Separated concerns in custom hooks
   - Maintained clear component boundaries

### Module Decoupling Strategy

1. **Component Architecture**
   - Implemented Container/Presenter pattern
   - Separated UI logic from business logic
   - Created reusable UI components
   - Maintained unidirectional data flow

2. **State Management**
   - Centralized global state in Redux
   - Used local state for UI-specific concerns
   - Implemented proper state normalization
   - Created feature-specific slices

3. **Data Flow**
   - Established clear data flow patterns
   - Implemented proper error handling
   - Created loading states
   - Maintained data consistency

### Development Process

1. **Incremental Development**
   - Started with core features
   - Added features incrementally
   - Maintained backward compatibility
   - Ensured proper testing at each step

2. **Code Organization**
   - Created feature-based structure
   - Separated concerns in files
   - Maintained consistent naming
   - Implemented proper documentation

3. **Testing & Debugging Strategy**
   - Browser-based testing across different devices
   - Console logging for API responses and state changes
   - React DevTools for component inspection
   - Manual testing of user flows
   - Cross-browser compatibility testing
   - Responsive design testing using browser dev tools
   - Error boundary implementation for graceful error handling

4. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Console timing for API calls
   - React DevTools Profiler for component rendering
   - Network tab monitoring for API performance
   - Memory usage tracking
   - State update optimization using useMemo
   - Component memoization with React.memo
   - Function memoization with useCallback
   - Optimized sorting logic with memoized price parsing
   - Reduced re-renders through component isolation
   - Efficient list rendering with memoized components
